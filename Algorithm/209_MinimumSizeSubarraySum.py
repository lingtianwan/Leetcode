# Given an array of n positive integers and a positive integer s, find the minimal length of a subarray of which the sum â‰¥ s. If there isn't one, return 0 instead.
#
# For example, given the array [2,3,1,2,4,3] and s = 7,
# the subarray [4,3] has the minimal length under the problem constraint.

# More practice:
# If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution of which the time complexity is O(n log n).

# Given a binary search tree, write a function kthSmallest to find the kth smallest element in it.
#
# Note:
# You may assume k is always valid, 1 â‰¤ k â‰¤ BST's total elements.
#
# Follow up:
# What if the BST is modified (insert/delete operations) often and you need to find the kth smallest frequently? How would you optimize the kthSmallest routine?
#
# Hint:
#
# Try to utilize the property of a BST.
# What if you could modify the BST node's structure?
# The optimal runtime complexity is O(height of BST).
